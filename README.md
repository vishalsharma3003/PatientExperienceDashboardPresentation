# PatientExperienceDashboardPresentation

The patient experience dashboard is a part of [NHS Patient Experience Framework](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/215159/dh_132788.pdf).

The framework outlines eight critical elements for patients' experience of NHS Service:

* Respect for patient-centered values, preferences, and expressed needs
* Coordination and integration of care
* Information, communication, and education
* Physical comfort
* Emotional support
* Welcoming the involvement of family and friends
* Transition and continuity
* Access to care

Patient Experience Dashboard offers insight into patients' perspectives on the quality, effectiveness, and promptness of care. By displaying patient experience data in one place, the Patient Experience Dashboard makes it easy for NHS staff to check in on patient experience and address problem areas as they arise. These patient insights are helpful in short- and long-term planning and can prove particularly critical as part of a hospital's quality improvement efforts.

This presentation aims to highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and improvements in the existing patient experience dashboard by NHS CDU Data Science Team.
