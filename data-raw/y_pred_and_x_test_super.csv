Service Quality/Outcomes,There needs to be a better system at Belgrave Health Centre for registering a patient arrival as I frequently couldnt tell Charanji that Id arrive and so often had a long wait for appointment starts I was asked on 2 occasions to do homework which I saw as integral to the therapy I found the work both challenging to do and challenging my thoughts and behaviors However I persisted and made sure Id completed it to hand it at the next sessions On neither occasion was my work looked atassessedprepared for the next session This meant that I got no feedback trends or patterns from what Id done  it meant that I felt that I had nothing to work on and had done the work for nothing   At the start I was asked to complete a 4week commitment form  which was never handed in told not needed However on week 3 I was told that I shouldnt be getting any more treatment but with supervisor advise Charanjit could continue My 4th session was minimal  arrive apologies and go  as the supervisor had my work  Ive actually found the referral and treatment process as opposed to the therapeutic sessions have added considerably to my stress levels To this end I refused the option of step 3 counselling However work would like me to continue to get more support  I was very grateful for being accepted onto the step 2 as I had been rejected as not fitting the criteria for either Open Minds or Amica initially I feel Im far more in control so it was a big jolt to cope with to be asked by work and invited by Charanjit to move to step 3

Service Quality/Outcomes,when a hospital professional refers someone with severe anxiety symptoms that raised his heart rate dangerously high and put him in a catatonic state mute completely rigid and unable to respond do not dismiss it all as being irrelevant and decide as a support worker probably with NVQ level 1 that you know better than a senior paramedic experienced ambulance crew doctor in charge at AE and an excellent mental health professional who got my son talking calmed him down and referred him to your service in the expectation he would get the help he needed Also just because the patient does not have any history of mental illness on the system doesnt mean he hasnt if he has been reluctant to go to the doctor to discuss things Support worker X did not even know my sons age so had obviously not read the report from the mental health professional at the hospital  She talked to me like I had low intelligence when I tried to talk about previous problems he had  Naturally she was respecting his privacy but shouldnt a professional have told me she couldnt discuss it with me due to patient confidentiality It also obviously did not occur to her that my son might be intelligent enough to mask his symptoms again it appears a lack of professional training She left repeatedly thanking me for the nice cup of tea made for her and colleague to hopefully create a relaxed atmosphere to get my son talking in the garden with them as he requested She left details of a counselling service with him and said that some people just dont want to talk maybe he will when hes 30 Very useful There must surely be other support from a professional other than counselling that my son has already rejected  My son stayed out all night and was throwing things around in his room this morning but he doesnt need any support according to Jo

Care/ Treatment,I have answered poor in response to question 7  however I believe the service in my case was very restricted due to the fact that I am only  on remand and have been for 9 months I am very pleased  and have a great deal of respect for the team which has been seeingtalking to me but I have now spent so much time due to my remand status without a tailormade package that I now feel it is far too late i feel much worse ACCT Reviews  I realise that ACCT revies do not really fall within your remit but I have several concerns as do many other women regards same 1 therre does not appear to be a great deal of  continuity  in that in my case at least different members of staff have attended each time this leads to women having to relate exactly the same thoughts and worries time and time again a process that leaves women with the impression that they have not been listened to in the first instance  resulting in a lack of confidence in the ACCT process itself In my case for example you do not selfharm do you has been asked at several reviews In actual fact I do  and this has been or so I thought documented many months ago Other women have given me several more examples We all find this embarrassing to discuss when we are all at our lowest ebb  without having to relate time and time again 2 We all feel that women should not be outnumbered by men at an ACCT review  I have yet to meet an inmate who is happy about this Continuity should and could be maintained by having at least one member of staff being present at an inmates review each and every time  if officers cannot attend then perhaps a A nurse b IMB member C Listener etc or perhaps postpone an ACCT review so that the inmates personal officer can be in attendence each time that is assuming tha thte inmate would agree to it and gets on with them  not all prisoners do 4 All ACCT reviews should be held in a more appropriate setting  and not in an office with constant interruptions Every woman I have spoken to has mentioned that a The interruptions upset them b they cannot concentrate and feel uncomfortable and in the way c They feel you are not concentrating on what they say and therefore they are an after thought when they are feeling at their worst  and  depressed and suicidal d They feel hurried and that you have more important things to do  undermining them 5 When officers conduct checks on women durng the night it would be a good idea if they all followed a set procedure  1 Put night light on first if no response 2 put main light on if no response 3 then knock if no response 4 then shoutsome officers are unnecesarily noisy and disturb everyone else on the wing  leading to the person on the ACCT being confronted the next morning This is the last thing they need when depressed and suicidal A bit more consideration would go a long way Not only that I believe sleep deprivation is the root cause of a great deal of the stress and anxiety many prisoners feel We work from 9am to 5pm and should all be allowed the opportunity of uninterrupted sleep  as the officers are I feel that all inmates  wehter sentenced or on  remand should be assessed and treated equally Many inmates  such as myself  are on remand for many months  some for over a year Please beleive me when I tell you that many of these women need help immdediately  this is mainly due to the fact that when on remand EVERYTHING is so uncertain and frightening PS I have been waiting since 25th october 12 for new prescription glasses  so please excuse my scribble I can only just read it myself pps I am aware that the opticians are from a private company out of your control
